            One common myth that often circulates is the belief that humans only use 10% of their brains. However the statement has shown to be false.
            Current neuroscientific research shows that the human brain is very active, with each region
            serving specific functions. Nearly all areas of the brain
            have identifiable roles. The myth likely originated from a misinterpretation of early neuroscience findings, and it has
            persisted as an appealing but inaccurate concept.
